# MyProjects

A series of scripts to automate.

#HouseChores
Works on automating room tasks with the script running once a week
Columns of edit are: Mopping,Dishes and Buying vegetables.
Buying greens runs on a continuous repetitive loop week to week.
The column of those washing dishes and that of mopping is arranged at random with the last individual who did it not being the first to do it in the subsequent week.

ToDo List
Add mail
*Add text message functionality

#Narrative
This works by:
   accepting user input on relevant details
   taking a pdf from the current working directory ,
   converting the pdf to a text file and editing the text file with the users details
   Making the converted text file a pdf and displaying it to the user

ToDo List
Add more categories of narratives to the directory with a menu to choose from.
Add mail functionality to allow participants if any to get mail of the resultant file.
*Use a database to store the pdf files
